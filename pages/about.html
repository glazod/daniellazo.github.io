        <h1>Hi, I'm Dan</h1>
        <p>
          I'm a Business Intelligence Manager with years of experience delivering Data Analytics, Automation, and AI solutions for WHQ Internal Audit and FP&A at a global Fortune 500 company. I have a background in Finance and a passion for creative problem-solving, which has taken me though a challenging and fulfilling career journey thus far.
        </p>
        <p>
          My toolkit centers on the Microsoft Power Platform — Power BI, Power Automate, Power Apps, and Copilot Studio — alongside heavy use of Excel and moderate use of SQL and Python. I strongly believe in servant leaderhip and lead a global team of developers that help me grow as a manager and developer myself.
        </p>
        <p>
          I embrace agile and am certified as a CSPO and SCRUM Master specialize in scalable reporting, workflow automation, and data integration across platforms like SAP S/4HANA, Oracle HFM, SAP Concur, Ariba, Blackline, ServiceNow, and AuditBoard. I currently sit within Internal Audit and serve as a strategic partner to our Finance Transformation office.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of work, I’m a lifelong learner — I love reading books and articles, and anything in betweem. I also enjoy podcasts and informative videos. My latest on the former are Naval Ravikant and Paul Graham. On the latter, Diary of a CEO is a new favorite podcast. I also enjoy the outdoors, working on my Jeep Wrangler, and spending time with my dog Chloe and cat Louie.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm building this portfolio to share my work across BI, Automation, and AI. I hope you can find this valuable. Always fell free to reach out!
