  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>I have loved computers since my dad purchased a Pentium III computer back in 2003 and, due to lack of space in our small apartment in Cuba, placed it in corner of my shared bedroom. I'm not sure if he though that through.</p>

  <p>I proceeded to spend countless hours in front of the computer playing game demos, flash games, and surprisingly, using Power Point. Back then we had not yet migrated to the United States and access to the Internet was illegal. Without the possibility of downloading games or software outside of passing around a USB flash memory with light flash games and demos, Microsoft Paint and Power Point is all I had to express my creative side.</p>

  <p>Was I putting together decks with waterfall charts to track EBIT over time? Compare actuals vs. forecast? Walk the CFO through the segment's P&L? Thankfully no. I was 10 years old. What I did do with Power Point was to create animations, birthday postcards, funny stories, and the like. I would insert two pictures of a family member, say my dad, remove the background, and have him run around by having the two pictures appear and reappear in intervals of 0.5s while moving from left to right on the screen. Over time these animations became longer and more complex, with additional characters introduced to my stories, and all sorts of transitions and drawings and text. It was fun. It was addictive. It was all I had.</p>

  <h2>Leaving the island</h2>
  <p>Fast forward to November of 2007 when, on a quiet autumn afternoon, I opened the door of our apartment to knocks from two Postal Office workers, one of them holding a big bulky envelope. They were there to deliver, for a price, a few documents that my parents needed to continue their application for the American Diversity Visa Program. Unbeknownst to me, my parents had been applying to this program (also known as the Green Card Lottery) as early as 1998. After coming to an agreement with the Postal Office mafia, and verifying that the documents were legitimately sent by the US government, we sold everything we had, continued the application, and by April of the following year we were in Miami, starting a whole new life.</p>

  <p>Starting High School as a sophomore with no knowledge of the English language was a challenge, but I've always had a passion for learning, and challenges. Within one year I passed the English as a Second Language (ESL) exams and entered into Advanced Placement (AP) courses. During my Junior year I was also placed in the Gifted Program after taking an assessment provided by Miami-Dade County Public Schools (MDCPS), and by Senior year of High School I was taking a few Dual Enrollment courses in English and Calculus with Florida International University I was also working a part-time job as a bagger at Publix Supermarkets which tremendously helped with my English, helping my family, and becoming a bit more independent.</p>

  <p>But after graduating High School I didn't attend FIU. Instead, I went for Miami Dade Honors College. Not only was tuition free after getting into the Honors program, but it was a great opportunity to integrate into college after just 3 years in the country. At Miami Dade College I achieved a 3.9 GPA which got me the Eduardo Padron Scholarship to attend FIU tuition-free. Despite being accepted into universities like Berkeley and UCLA for a reduced tuition, I could not look past the opportunity to have a college degree and no debt.</p>

  <p>At FIU I continued my studies in Finance and International Business, quit Publix Supermarkets and took an internship with StateFarm, then United Technologies Aerospace Systems (UTAS), and by Senior year I had an offer to join the UTC Financial Leadership program in Connecticut. During this time I had also served as Treasurer and then President of the local Alpha Kappa Psi chapter at FIU, which alongside my internship experience propelled me tremendously in my career.</p>
