  <section id="problem-overview">
    <h2>1. Problem Overview</h2>
    <p>Global and regional controllers do not have a seamless way to track aged overdue issues raised from SOX Reviews or Internal Audit engagements. A key component of what Controllership tracks is aged overdue issues, which are reported to the companyâ€™s Chief Accounting Office and CFO monthly. These issues are critical to resolve timely as they can cover anything from lack of internal controls around the revenue recognition process to risks around financial misstatements. While AuditBoard comes with a set of pre-built dashboards, none are capable of tracking aged overdue issues. A custom dashboard must be built for visibility into these issues.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="stakeholder-needs">
    <h2>2. Stakeholder Needs</h2>
    <p>Controllers can track overdue aged issues assigned to their segment. It is also possible to view these issues based on assigned impact and aging bucket. Additionally, users can navigate directly from the dashboard to the specific issue in the system with a single click.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="project-planning">
    <h2>3. Project Planning</h2>
    <p>CRISP-DM & Agile methodology are used throughout the project. Five weeks might seem like a long time, but with other competing priorities the seemingly available 200 hours get reduced to anywhere from 75 â€“ 100, which can be extremely overwhelming for just one developer.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="challenges">
    <h2>4. Key Challenges</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Power BI dashboard must be accessed through AuditBoard, not Power BI Service â€“ a series of steps need to be followed, such as having admin rights to install and manage the database via PgAdmin</li>
        <li>Connection to the data must be done through the ABI Database with Direct Query mode, not Import Mode via AuditBoard Report APIs â€“ Direct Query mode poses challenges as it limits transformations in Power Query</li>
        <li>Tight time lime</li>
        <li>Limit permissions in the database â€“ cannot create own views, leaving the transformation to Power Query, not SQL</li>
        <li>No data dictionary â€“ challenging due to custom_text_1 fields</li>
        <li>Limited funding â€“ just me working on this</li>
        <li>Issue aging must be calculated based on Action Plan date</li>
    </ul>
        
  </section>

  <section id="data-exploration">
    <h2>5. Data Exploration</h2>
    <p>For data exploration, the key objective is to understand the system and its processes while having the userâ€™s objectives in mind. For this project, there was a series of fields from the system that the users wanted to visualize. But the main challenge was to introduce a new calculation for issue aging. 

    Issue aging = Todayâ€™s date â€“ Issue Action Planâ€™s Due Date1
    1In cases where 1 issue has more than one action plan, the latest due date is taken

  <section id="outcomes">
    <h2>12. Key Outcomes</h2>
    <p>It's more effective to use the AuditBoard API for scalable access to issue data. But having the access through the system saved lots of time adding people and money as they do not need to have a Power BI Pro license
