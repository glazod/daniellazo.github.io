  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>In 2020, I made a deliberate shift toward self-discovery that evolved into a deep passion for building Business Intelligence solutions that drive real impact. What started with developing tools in the Microsoft Power Platform (Power BI, Power Apps, Power Automate, and Copilot Studio) quickly expanded into leading a global team of developers and, ultimately, spearheading Finance Transformation initiatives within a Fortune 500 organization.</p>

<h2>How did I get here?</h2>

<p>
From 2013 to 2016 I attended Florida International University,  where I studied Finance and International Business while serving as Treasurer and President of Alpha Kappa Psi, the professional business fraternity. While my academic focus was Finance, my interests consistently gravitated toward technology and systems optimization. I was drawn to understanding not just financial outcomes, but the processes and tools that produced them - a mindset that would later shape my approach to analytics and transformation.
</p>

<h3>Early Careers</h3>
<p>
I started my career in finance through Raytheon's Financial Leadership Program, rotating across supply chain finance, operations accounting, and FP&A roles in the U.S. and abroad. Very early on, I realized I was less interested in maintaining processes and more interested in improving them. If something was manual, repetitive, or unclear, I felt compelled to redesign it.
</p>

<h3>Internal Audit</h3>
<p>
After the program, I joined Internal Audit at Carrier during its corporate spin-off. That period forced the organization to rethink structure, controls, and reporting — and it created space to rethink how data was being used. What began as building a few Power BI dashboards for my own analyses turned into something much bigger: the creation of a global Data Analytics capability within Internal Audit.
</p>

<p>
Over the next several years, I formalized that function — developing standardized analytics frameworks, continuous monitoring solutions, automation workflows, and AI-powered tools. What started as individual productivity improvements evolved into scalable systems used across regions. I built and led a distributed team and helped shift audit from reactive sampling to structured, data-driven execution.
</p>

<h3>Finance Transformation</h3>
<p>
In 2025, I transitioned into Finance Transformation, where the scope expanded beyond audit into enterprise-level analytics and automation. My focus now is designing systems that align finance, data architecture, and business decision-making — not just producing dashboards, but enabling smarter operating models.
</p>

<p>
At my core, I’m driven by one question: how can we redesign the way work gets done so that people focus less on manual effort and more on high-value thinking?
