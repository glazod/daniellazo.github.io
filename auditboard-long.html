  <section id="problem-overview">
    <h2>1. Problem Overview</h2>
    <p>A key component of what Controllership tracks is aged overdue issues, which are reported to the companyâ€™s Chief Accounting Office and CFO monthly. These issues are critical to resolve timely as they can cover anything from lack of internal controls around the revenue recognition process to risks around financial misstatements. While AuditBoard comes with a set of pre-built dashboards, none are capable of tracking aged overdue issues.
    <br><br>
    In a nutshell, global and regional controllers do not have a seamless way to track the aging of open overdue issues raised from SOX Reviews or Internal Audit engagements. As such, a custom dashboard must be built for visibility into these issues.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="stakeholder-expectations">
    <h2>2. Stakeholder Expectations</h2>
    <p>Controllers are able to track overdue aged issues assigned to their segment. It is also possible to view these issues based on assigned impact and aging bucket. Additionally, users can navigate directly from the dashboard to the specific issue in the system with a single click.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="project-planning">
    <h2>3. Project Planning</h2>
    <p>CRISP-DM & Agile methodology are used throughout the project. Five weeks might seem like a long time, but with other competing priorities the seemingly available 200 hours get reduced to anywhere from 75 â€“ 100, which can be extremely overwhelming for just one developer.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="challenges">
    <h2>4. Key Challenges</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The dashboard is built in Power BI, but the Power BI dashboard must be accessed through AuditBoard, not Power BI Service â€“ a series of steps need to be followed, such as having admin rights to install and manage the database via PgAdmin</li>
        <li>Connection to the data must be done through the ABI Database with Direct Query mode, not Import Mode via AuditBoard Report APIs â€“ Direct Query mode poses challenges as it limits transformations in Power Query</li>
        <li>Tight time lime at 5 weeks to deliver with one allocated resource working on other competing priorities</li>
        <li>Limit permissions in the database â€“ cannot create own views, leaving the transformation to Power Query, not SQL</li>
        <li>No data dictionarys</li>
        <li>Limited funding â€“ no additional heads</li>
        <li>Issue aging, the ultimate metric, must be calculated based on Action Plan date, not on Issue Resolution (more on that later)</li>
    </ul>

  <section id="architecture">
    <h2>6. Solution Architecture</h2>
  </section>

  <section id="data-exploration">
    <h2>5. Data Exploration</h2>
    <p>For data exploration, the key objective is to understand the system and its processes while having the userâ€™s objectives in mind. For this project, there was a series of fields from the system that the users wanted to visualize. But the main challenge was to introduce a new calculation for issue aging. 

    Issue aging = Todayâ€™s date â€“ Issue Action Planâ€™s Due Date1
    1In cases where 1 issue has more than one action plan, the latest due date is taken
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="etl">
  <h2>7. The ETL Process</h2>
  <p> The ETL Process at a high level is simple. Data was pulled form the database into Power Query via DirectQuery mode, and transformed in Power Query as much as query folding would allow. Data was loaded to the Data Model and visualized after a series of calculations. </p>

  </section>

  <section id="testing">
    <h2>10. Testing & Deployment</h2>
    <p>Testing took place on a weekly cadence in collaboration with Controllership. Data from the AuditBoard user interface was extracted from the Issues and Action Plan modules, combined in Excel, and analyzed to determine the latest Action Plan Due Date, after which a calculation was performed to bucket the Open Operdue Issues.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="maintenance">
    <h2>11. Support & Maintenance</h2>
    <p>Support for this dashboard was minimal, since stakeholder needs and expectations were set forth from the start. Since the dashboard was not hoste in Power BI service, users who were granted access to AuditBoard under certain groups automatically had access to the dashboard.</p>
