  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>In 2020, I made a deliberate shift toward self-discovery that evolved into a deep passion for building Business Intelligence solutions that drive real impact. What started with developing tools in the Microsoft Power Platform (Power BI, Power Apps, Power Automate, and Copilot Studio) quickly expanded into leading a global team of developers and, ultimately, spearheading Finance Transformation initiatives within a Fortune 500 organization.</p>

<h2>How did I get here?</h2>

<h3>A passion for technology</h3>
<p>At FIU, I studied Finance and International Business while transitioning from working at Publix to interning at State Farm and later United Technologies Aerospace Systems (UTAS). By senior year, I had earned an offer to join the UTC Financial Leadership Program in Connecticut. During that time, I also served as Treasurer and later President of the Alpha Kappa Psi chapter at FIU. Those leadership experiences, combined with hands-on internship exposure, accelerated my professional growth early on.</p>

<h2>Finance Leadership Program</h2>
<p>At 23 years old—nine years after leaving Cuba—I moved to Connecticut to begin the UTC Financial Leadership Program. It was my first time living away from Miami and my family. The cultural shift was significant. Miami had always felt familiar and supportive; Connecticut felt foreign. But growth rarely happens inside comfort zones.</p>

<p>Through six-month rotations across UTAS, Pratt & Whitney, and Carrier, I worked in Supply Chain Finance, Operations Accounting, and FP&A. I lived in Connecticut, Arkansas, North Carolina, and later the United Kingdom as an expat. My approach during each rotation went beyond completing deliverables. I focused on transforming processes quickly — streamlining reporting through Excel automation and structured documentation to leave every role more efficient than I found it.</p>

<h2>Internal Audit</h2>
<p>In 2019, after graduating from the program, I joined Internal Audit at Carrier Corporation during the spin-off from United Technologies (which later became Raytheon Technologies). I relocated to Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, and stepped into a role that combined finance, operations, and international exposure.</p>

<h2>COVID-19</h2>
<p>I officially joined Internal Audit in January 2020. My first audits took me to Georgia, North Carolina, and Tennessee, with Brazil, Chile, Argentina, and Jamaica on the calendar. Then in March, while in Memphis, the world changed. COVID-19 halted travel and moved audit operations entirely online.</p>

<p>Like many others, I shifted to remote work—operating out of a small studio apartment I had chosen because I expected to travel most of the month. Suddenly, I had time and constraints. And that combination sparked something.</p>

<h2>Data Analytics</h2>
<p>I decided to learn programming, starting with MIT’s Introduction to Python and Harvard’s CS50. While valuable, I struggled to directly apply that knowledge within corporate IT constraints. So I reset.</p>

<p>I took the Coursera course “Learning How to Learn.” Four weeks focused purely on understanding how the brain absorbs and retains information.</p>

<p>It was a turning point.</p>

<p>By the end of that course, I had identified my next focus: Microsoft Power BI and the broader Power Platform. Unlike pure programming, this ecosystem allowed me to apply automation and analytics directly within the business environment.</p>

<h2>Building the Internal Audit Data Analytics Function</h2>
<p>By late 2020, I had quietly built my first Power BI dashboards—offline tools designed to detect anomalies and trends in audit data. Initially, they were overlooked. I was encouraged to stay within traditional audit methods.</p>

<p>But I believed strongly that analytics could fundamentally change how we audited.</p>

<p>Eventually, I found leadership alignment. In 2021, organizational changes created the opportunity to formally build out an Internal Audit Data Analytics function. Within a year, we introduced:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Finalytics – A standardized Power BI scoping tool leveraging HFM data</li>
  <li>The Data Analytics Library – Structured templates for revenue, duplicates, reconciliations, and more</li>
  <li>Continuous Monitoring for Travel & Expense</li>
</ul>

<p>These solutions shifted audit from reactive sampling to structured, data-driven analysis. Over the next three years, the function expanded from a one-person initiative to a global team with dedicated resources across regions. We developed monitoring solutions across ServiceNow, Ariba, HFM, and AuditBoard, introduced RPA workflows, and in 2025 launched Carrier’s first Copilot Studio agent—the Walkthrough Wizard—followed by additional AI agents and Power Apps to streamline audit execution.</p>

<h2>Finance Transformation</h2>
<p>In 2025, Carrier launched a Finance Transformation Office focused on reimagining how Finance operates through analytics and automation. I began allocating 50% of my time to this initiative, positioning myself at the center of its data and automation strategy. This work represents the next evolution: scaling analytics beyond audit into enterprise-wide transformation.</p>

<h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
<p>My goal is simple: help organizations move from reporting to transformation. The Microsoft Power Platform—and modern data architecture more broadly—offers enormous potential to redesign how businesses operate. I’m committed to building solutions that don’t just analyze data, but fundamentally improve how work gets done.</p>
